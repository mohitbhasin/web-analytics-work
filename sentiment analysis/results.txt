i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .

there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .

just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .

after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !

i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
['perfect', 'superior', 'great', 'work']

Positive

i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
['prefer', 'best']
[]
Positive

my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
['favorite']
[]
Positive

the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
['audible']
['noise']
Neutral

the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
['blessing']
[]
Positive

the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
['winner', 'recommend']

good phone , so-so service .

the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .

Neutral

after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
[]
['expensive', 'horrible']
Negative

i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
['decent']
[]
Positive

here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
['cute', 'pretty', 'sturdy']
['break']
Positive

it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
['cute', 'favorite']
[]
Positive

i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
[]
['unpredictable']
Negative

also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
['work']
['tedious']
Neutral

the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
['good', 'like']
['hurts']
Positive

the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
['decent']
[]
Positive

the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
['liked', 'crisp']
[]
Positive

however , it serves its purpose .
[]
[]
Neutral

the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
[]
['dangerous']
Negative

i checked with nokia .
[]
[]
Neutral

the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
[]
[]
Neutral

the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
[]
['uncreative']
Negative

more downside to this phone ?
[]
['downside']
Negative

the volume .
[]
[]
Neutral

oh my goodness --
['goodness']
[]
Positive

i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
['quiet', 'excellent']

forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !

on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .

i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .

i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
[]
[]
Neutral

i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
['exceptional']
['horrendous']
Neutral

reason ?
[]
[]
Neutral

they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
[]
[]
Neutral

also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
['works']
['cheap']
Neutral

since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .
['work', 'promised']
[]
Positive

i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
['worked']
[]
Positive

24 hours ?
[]
[]
Neutral

by what time standards -- martian ?
[]
[]
Neutral

apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
[]
['back-logged']
Negative

also , they 'd forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
['capability']
[]
Positive

in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
['nice', 'fairness']
['hard']
Positive

but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a " yes " answer from you .
[]
['annoying']
Negative

i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
['right', 'assurance']
[]
Positive

" when will my t-zones work ? " , csr :
['work']
[]
Positive

" i 'm not sure " . ) .
[]
[]
Neutral

umm , well , thanks for nothing .
['well']
[]
Positive

this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
['well']
[]
Positive

that was annoying .
[]
['annoying']
Negative

t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
['good', 'pretty']
['hard']
Positive

however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
['clear']
[]
Positive

and no t-zones .
[]
[]
Neutral

so what 's the point ?
[]
[]
Neutral

i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
['good', 'clarity', 'exceptional']
['fear']

i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .

it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .

Positive

the phone refused to die .

i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .

recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .

disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
['revive']

two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .

while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .

i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .

Positive

best phone for free .
['best', 'free']
[]
Positive

i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
['best']
[]
Positive

no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
[]
[]
Neutral

from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
['clarity', 'nifty']

Positive

whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .

i treat the battery well and it has lasted .

at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
[]
[]
Neutral

it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .

[]
Neutral

signal strength will affect the battery life .

[]
Neutral

frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
[]

i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .

Neutral

i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
[]
['unbearable', 'scratch']
Negative

the volume level of the phone is not all that good .

Positive

some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
['easy']
[]
Positive

the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
[]
['hard']
Negative

the vibration is not top .
['top']
['vibration']
Neutral

it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
[]
['hard']
Negative

i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
['easier']
['vibrate', 'vibration']

vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .

so it was no loss .

t-mobile was a pretty good server .

menu flaws ? mine could n't send text messages .

when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :

so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .

i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .

he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .

so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .

while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .

this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .

as said before this works perfectly .

you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
[]
['disturbance']
Negative

the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
['perfectly']
[]
Positive

you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
['work', 'perfectly']
[]
Positive

only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
[]
['complaint']
Negative

the radio :
[]
[]
Neutral

this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
[]
[]
Neutral

this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
['fairly', 'good', 'decent', 'work', 'perfectly', 'clearly']
[]

tri-band :

one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
['beneficial']

i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .

the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .

anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .

if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .

sold in other parts of the world :
[]

another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .

[]
Positive

this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
['good', 'like']
['break']
Positive

or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
[]
[]

i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
['enough', 'benefit']
['stress']
Positive

able to use service in another country :
[]
[]
Neutral

if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
[]
[]
Neutral

you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .

size and weight :
[]
[]
Neutral

when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .

this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .

battery life :

the battery life on this phone is surreal .
['surreal']

it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .

i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
[]

it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
['amazing']
[]
Positive

this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .

the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .

the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .

['weird', 'funky']

the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .

the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
[]

Neutral

thumbs down on that one .

the vibrate setting is loud !

so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .

other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .

the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .

sound quality :

the most important thing for me is sound quality .
['important']
[]
Positive

nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
['good']
[]
Positive

i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
['better']
[]
Positive

the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
['great', 'right']
['loud']
Positive

overall design :

[]
Neutral

i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
['like']
[]
Positive

of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
[]
[]
Neutral

the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
[]
[]
Neutral

as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
['better', 'like']
['scratch']
Positive

ease of use :
['ease']
[]
Positive

how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?

the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
['like']

that is a very nice feature .
['nice']
[]
Positive

the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
['easier']

the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .

[]
Neutral

battery :
[]
[]
Neutral

the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .

the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .

features :

the t610 has the most functionality hands down .

my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .

the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .

the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .

it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .

the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .

in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .

if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .

they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .

one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
[]
[]
Neutral

every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
[]
[]
Neutral

anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
[]

tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .

this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .

( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )

other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .

finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
[]
['thumbs-down']
Negative

their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .

if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .

the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
['great']
[]
Positive

when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
[]
[]
Neutral

after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
['perfect']
[]
Positive

it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
['comfortable']
[]
Positive

the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
[]
['mess']
Negative

unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .

when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .

the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
['bright', 'good']

the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .

i like the default blue .

you can also set a background wallpaper .

the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?

no more annoying series of beeps .

this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .

Positive

you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
[]
[]
Neutral

the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
['work']
[]
Positive

the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
['cool']
['alarm']
Neutral

the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
['useful']

you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .

the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .

one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
['support']

their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .

i have been assured this will be fixed soon .

i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .

if you have a question , they have the answer .

and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .

every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .

the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .

different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .

the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .

nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
['great', 'clear']
[]
Positive

with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
['accessible', 'great']
['complicated']
Positive

the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
[]
['lack', 'disappointment']
Negative

one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a " worldphone " and can be used in europe , etc.
[]
[]
Neutral

yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
[]
[]
Neutral

the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
['work']
[]
Positive

therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
[]
[]
Neutral

after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
[]
[]
Neutral

bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
[]
[]
Neutral

find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
