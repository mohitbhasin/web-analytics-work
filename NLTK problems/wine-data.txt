Lovely delicate, fragrant Rhone wine. Polished leather and strawberries. Perhaps a bit dilute, but good for drinking now.	***
Liquorice, cherry fruit. Simple and coarse at the finish.	**
Thin and completely uninspiring.	*
Big, fat, textured Chardonnay - nuts and butterscotch. A slightly odd metallic/cardboard finish, but probably	***

Charming, violet-fragranced nose. Classic Guigal Cote Rotie.	****
Good grip and a touch of rusticity on the length. VA showing through. On the downhill slope. Just	****
Just about holding together - drying out a touch at the finish. Not as good as I thought this would be. A good	***
In your face wine - rather obvious and simple (although some structure did begin to show through).	***
Some volatility, and all over the place on the nose and palate. It did come together more with time.	***
Gummy nose, merlot-style sweetness. Good wine, but not in a style I was expecting.	****
Hot on the palate, but good balance with some maturity.	***
This has a Rhonish air to it, feels quite young, but it is also a bit simple.	***
Liquorice. Fruit beginning to dry out.	**
Good sweetly fragranced wine. Drink now. Top	***
A big nose of public swimming pools - bizarre (some might say funky).	*
All quite refined and delicate, appley pinot fruit, autolytic flavours. Another fairly recent disgorgement after 4 years in cellars (credit the producer for an excellent back label), it just seems a bit lacking in intensity despite the obvious quality. Perhaps this will develop but for now a good	***
Good fruit - nice acidity. Pretty intense although it seems quite evolved for a young wine - I fear it may go down the Ozzy route of rather early flabby kerosene flavours. Top	**
Pretty nice. Clean, rich, yet decently taught. A credit to the appelation. Bare	***
Very light and delicate - decent but a bit attenuated. I have had better bottles.	***
Dry, savoury, quite succulent. Pleasantly high-toned, nervy, and a bit awkward. A wine with a sense of place and hence enjoyable.	***
Curiously quiet, but concentration and fruit quality are all there. Maybe just in a dull phase - perhaps it would have shown better decanted and allowed a little air.	***
Leafy, dry, decent balance. Good wine but I doubt it's going anywhere much. Pleasant, and perhaps it would reward further attention.	**
Quite baked, decent concentration - slightly hot finish. I recall having had better from this producer.	**
Refined, smooth sweet (to a controlled extent) - very drinkable. Forward fruit but with the balance to hold it - the best of the New World reds, to my palate. Top	***
A bit anonymous in some ways, but very nicely poised fairly concentrated dessert wine - from the South of France somewhere, I guess. I suspect this would repay more attention and on that basis	***
Beautifully refined. Complex, elegant, long with the amazing precision so typical of the producer. Lovely.	****
Eccentric - very rancio - complex and interesting - I need more time with this but for now	***
Very fresh, lifted, aromatic. Top	*
Dry, clean, unassuming. Touch of spritz.	*
Fruity, peachy. Dry again. More richness. Nice sense of place. I could even think of	***
Quite mouthfilling - dry, fruity. Nice.	**
Soft, cigar cassis fruit - sweet finish. Pleasant. Nice condition.	***
Soft blackcurrant fruit - with tannic background that starts to show in the midpalate. Odd balance.	**
A bit stinky at first - resolves - tar roses but the common old Barolo oxidativeness. Tarry - quite hard work. Actually probably good. Top	***
Rich again - gamy animal dry - could do with long decanting. Bare	****
Dark orange. Very barley-sugar - nice balance - appetizing finish.	***
Slightly lighter, fruitier. Slightly oily textured. Bare	***
A bit faded, pleasant, lightweight. Bare	***
Charming tempranillo sweet strawberry nose. Good balance and elegant. A good	***
Modern stuff, rather lacking depth and complexity.	**
At peak or just over. Rather like a decent Cotes-du-Rhone, with a rustic edge.	***
Pretty awful - very soft and commercial. Confected.	*
A slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage (1990 or 1996), possibly Krug, possibly Billecart. Lovely wine whatever. A touch of pink on the colour - a blush to cover our blushes. Elegant, good length and fine balanced acidity. A really good, cheap (under 15) fizz.	****
Mature with Grenache cherry showing through. Charming nose. Slightly simple on the palate. A good	***
A touch gummy and with a hint of leather. Drier than many. Robust.	****
Past its peak, although still very drinkable. Fruit is starting to dry out and a touch of volatility is appearing.	**
This vintage had a juiciness about the fruit that was lacking in the other wines, but was also maturing well - at an in-between phase I guess.	***
Green tannins, dry at the end, a long, soft, not that pleasant leathery length.	***
Vegetal blackcurrant. Soft and not together.	**
Very young and closed. Minty. But does it have the structure?	***
A stinky nose to start with. Leather, and just beginning to dry out.	***
a touch vegetal, and some volatility. Just	***
a bit of blackcurrant, clean and nicely together. A top	***
Some thought this stunk rather. I thought it the finest wine of this flight. Lovely fragrant mature Shiraz nose. At peak. Good.	****
Cream crackers on the nose (no that's not rhyming slang). Vanilla. Simple.	***

On the whole, well made stuff, but there does seem to be an odd dull metallic note to the wine. Otherwise there is soft, well-balanced fruit.	**
A good, fruity, balanced drink. Pleasant food or quaffing wine.	***
The usual Penfold's style - well made, and with a touch of volatility helping with the balance.	***
Dry, clean, nice piney (is that allowed?) spicy perhaps is better. Reasonable complexity once it has warmed up above the icy temperature at which it was served. Decent length. Top	**
Honied - interesting green-tinged high-toned fruit. Bone-dry and rather nice. Time to drink though. Bare	***
Fresh, grassy, a bit vegetal. Fruity and a touch sweet. Top	*
Drier, quite intense. Hints at almonds and lime.	**
A touch reductive/sulphury. Forward fruit - pleasantly dry. Top	**
Nice intensity. Aniseed. Fades a touch. Good value.	***
Intense pure cassis, ripe with some quite dry succulent tannins. Fairly sweet impression on the palate.	**
Sickly toffee-fudge nose. Sweet fruit. I don't like this.	*
Sweet soft-drink fruit. It expands a bit but I still find it too soft. For somebody who likes the style:	***
Quite sweet - very soft fruit. Herby and lifted. Decent	*
Still a bit soft for my palate - has Mt E always been this easy? Certainly the best of the three. Bare	***
Almost Madeira-like. It suffered a bit on serving - it was rather sedimenty. Pleasant but fading a bit.	**
Almost dry - nice, but no better than it should be given the reputation of the vintage.	***
Very classic cedary, mature Claret nose. Classic on the palate too, but there is an air of living dangerously, of corruption, and a general hint that the wine will crack up. Really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two.	***
Classic again on the nose, but a rather fresher, more stable palate with complex multi-faceted fruit. Once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high-toned. Drinking well and no hurry to consume.	****
I don't get to try an awful lot of Bacchus nowadays, although way back I used to attend the English Wine Fair and try samples there. I can't say I miss it much. This wine is floral, grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon-like flavours. Strangely for a cleanly made 11% white wine, it isn't the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it's not unpleasant, just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds. Hopefully the Champagne style Pinot that was also sent will be more interesting.	*
Lovely fizz, with good nutty steely age on the palate. Fine depth of flavour, although the palate does tire very slightly at the end. Really on very good form.	****
Good fruit and depth of colour. Very obvious new oak on the palate. Good drinkable modern wine.	***
Fragrant, dry palate, quite meaty and serious. Time to drink I guess - it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature. Rather enjoyable.	***
I don't often drink village Chablis. This is a good example of what you get from a good one: all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined. Best with food.	**
Quite tight and lean, I wondered a bit whether it wasn't a little thin when judged by the highest standards, but while not an absolute star, more and more emerged with some breathing. Very well-defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity. Excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage. Top	***
Lovely bright, crisp red fruits. Excellent concentration and balance, great fruit but bone dry. Just a lovely village wine, I thought at first - but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that. Top	***
Top, top quality. Creamy fruit, lean, complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage.	****
Very good village wine - good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage. Delicious. A good	***
Quite rich, forward, exotic fruit. Drinking nicely. This bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight, and then thawed - didn't seem to have done much damage, and as my host remarked it's an easy way of opening the bottle.	**
Pure, quite mineral, the fact that this is a "no new oak" wine very pleasingly evident. Quite a lot of richness to the fruit too, specially once it had been open for half an hour. Could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer. Nice wine. Bare	***
Understated, quite complex, but a little flat and dominated by a caramel/toffee overlay that I'm not keen on. Being a Tempier fan I was expecting a lot from this, but on this showing I'm not wildly keen.	**
Attractive and drinkable, but lacking the mineral complexity of the Launois NV drunk recently.	***
Pleasant mature rieslong - needing drinking fairly soon. Bare	***
From a magnum (well it was New Year's Eve). I think I've had this bottle for five plus years. Lovely stuff - beautifully balanced. Could still have used a few more years. A very easy	****
Deep colour, very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms. Evolved. Quite bold and rich. Long and delicious, provided you like the meaty, not so elegant, Bollinger style - it's not everyones glass of bubbles. Top	****
Mineral, nice fruit, dry and taught. Starting to drink nicely. Bare	****
Deep colour, rather lovely, gentle, long, mellow, nutty and delightful. Some say a little lacking poise or complexity but I quite like it.	***
Pure, quite light and aetherial (the vineyard perhaps). Nice length and texture. Pleasingly little oak. Still improving but may be won't merit another star. Pretty good.	***
Dry, nice, savoury, but time to drink. Top	***
Colour tending to brown. Quite animal, rich and decadent - fades a bit in the glass and rapidly becomes cloying.	**
Amazing dense young colour. Floral, mineral, tobacco. Iodine finish. Very fine indeed.	*****
